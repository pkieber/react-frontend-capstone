                  Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family owned
                  Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a
                  modern twist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture
                  and have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate
                  prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
                  moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
                  restaurant.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience
                  as a chef in Italy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to
                  expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
                  cuisines from the mediterranean region.
